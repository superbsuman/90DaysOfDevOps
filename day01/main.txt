WHAT IS DEVOPS

devops IS NOT A TOOL or A PROGRAM. devops is A MINDSET/CONCEPT to develop software in a smart way.

devops basically combines the development team and operation team to work together in sync to develop software seaminglessly.

to be a devops engineer, we have to have knowledge of linux, networking, cloud, containers, kubernetes and many more things revolving around that area.

one can not say he is a devops developer only after learning a software or completing a course. devops is more of a mindset to develop software smartly
